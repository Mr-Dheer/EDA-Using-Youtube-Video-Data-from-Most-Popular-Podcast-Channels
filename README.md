### EDA-Using-Youtube-Video-Data-from-Most-Popular-Podcast-Channels
This project focuses on conducting an in-depth analysis of YouTube videos in the podcast niche to understand the factors that influence video views, interaction (likes/comments), and overall performance. By exploring these aspects, valuable insights can be gained into the dynamics of successful YouTube channels in this specific domain.

### Project Steps

### Obtaining Video Metadata via YouTube API:
1. Utilized the YouTube API to retrieve video metadata for the top 10-15 channels in the podcast niche.
Created a developer key and made API requests to gather data on video titles, durations, likes, comments, and tags.
Transformed the received responses into a usable data format for further analysis.

2. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
Performed preprocessing on the acquired data to ensure data quality and enhance analysis capabilities.
Conducted feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the available information.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Delved into the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends through exploratory data analysis.
- Investigated relationships between factors such as the number of likes/comments and video views, video duration and interaction, and title length and views.
- Explored tag usage among successful videos to identify common tags that contribute to their performance.

#### Conclusions:
- Drew conclusions based on the analysis, highlighting the key factors influencing video performance in the podcast niche.
- Examined the impact of the number of likes/comments on views, the influence of video duration on interaction, and the role of title length in attracting views.
- Analyzed tag usage patterns among high-performing videos to identify effective tagging strategies.
- Explored the upload frequency and preferred upload days of creators in the podcast niche.
